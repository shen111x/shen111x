          <br><br> Client: Otis College of Art and Design
          <br><br>Delivery: Jan 2023
          <br><br><br>The Typography 3 project seamlessly integrates creativity and precision, highlighting advanced typographic techniques. The course cultivates a visually captivating design, embodying the transformative principles of Typography 3. As the semester concludes, all students are mandated to submit their books done in this class and participate in a school book fair. 
          <br><br>The project wasn't overly challenging, yet I faced the task of designing, printing, and posting the poster from scratch within just one hour. Despite the time constraints, I am pleased with the excellent outcome achieved for the poster.

          As the main focus of Typography 3 centered on typesetting, printing, and press-related aspects, my concept revolves around the printer's 'CMYK' four colors, creatively embodied in a 'set' form. This signifies both the multitude of books and the diverse design perspectives of each student.
